          <li>This is your main source of information for CS2103/T. You will need to refer to it weekly.</li>
<!--          
          <li>Recommended usage: At the start of each week, read the section corresponding to that week in the Schedule
            page.
            That should be good enough in general, unless you are keen to read ahead to find out what's coming up in
            future weeks.

          <li>Important bits of information are <span class="highlighted">highlighted</span>.
            Less important additional information are <span class="dim">dimmed out</span>.
          </li>
          <li>Details for the upcoming weeks will be added as the weeks progress.</li>
          <li>It also contains a lot of links to additional resources. It’s fine if you don’t have time to read them now.
            They are for your future reference too (i.e. after the semester is over).

          <li>You can access this page after this semester using this link
